# About me
I'm a first-year PhD scholar at <a href="https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/"> McGill University </a> and <a href="https://mila.quebec/en/"> Montreal Institute for Learning Algorithms (MILA) </a> where <a href="https://williamleif.github.io/"> Prof. William Hamilton</a> advises me. I completed my M.S by Research (<a href="https://priyeshv.github.io/MS_Thesis.pdf">Thesis</a>) at the Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IIT M) under the guidance ofÂ <a href="https://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~ravi/">Prof. Balaraman Ravindran</a>. I have a 5 years experience as a research staff working at IIT Madras where I was associated with the <a href="https://rbc-dsai.iitm.ac.in/">Robert Bosch Centre for Data Sciences and AI (RBCDSAI)</a> and <a href="https://rise-iil.github.io/">RISE Interactive Intelligence Lab</a>.


My research interests lie in the broad areas of Machine learning and Complex Networks, especially at their intersection where I model learning on network problems with Deep Learning and Factorization based approaches.
