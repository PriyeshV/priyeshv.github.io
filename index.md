# About me
I'm in my third year of MS by Research Programme at the CSE Dept. of IIT Madras. I work under the guidance of Dr. Balaraman Ravindran in R.I.S.E Lab. My research interests lie in the broad areas of Machine learning and Social Networks, especially in the intersection of both where I model learning on network problems with Deep Learning and Factorization approaches.
