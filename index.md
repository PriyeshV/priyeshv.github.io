# About me
I'm a first year PhD scholar at McGill University and Montreal Institute for Learning Algorithms (MILA) where i'm advised by <a href="https://williamleif.github.io/"> William Hamilton</a>. I completed by M.S by Research at Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IIT M) under the guidance of <a href="http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~ravi/"> Balaraman Ravindran</a>. I have a 5 years experience as a research staff in IIT Madras where I was associated with the Robert Bosch Centre for Data Science and AI (RBCDSAI) and R.I.S.E Lab in IIT Madras. 

My research interests lie in the broad areas of Machine learning and Complex Networks, especially at their intersection where I model learning on network problems with Deep Learning and Factorization based approaches.
