# About me
I'm a 4th year Ph.D. student at <a href="https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/"> McGill University </a> and <a href="https://mila.quebec/en/"> Mila - Quebec AI Institute</a>, where I'm supervised by <a href="https://cs.mcgill.ca/~dprecup/"> Doina Precup</a>. I completed my M.S by Research (<a href="https://priyeshv.github.io/MS_THESIS.pdf">Thesis</a>) at the Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IIT M) under the guidance ofÂ <a href="https://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~ravi/"> Balaraman Ravindran</a>. I have 5 years of experience as a research staff working at IIT Madras, where I was associated with the <a href="https://rbcdsai.iitm.ac.in/">Robert Bosch Centre for Data Sciences and AI (RBCDSAI)</a> and <a href="https://rise-iil.github.io/">RISE Interactive Intelligence Lab</a>.

My research interests lie in the broad areas of Reinforcement Learning, Deep Learning, and Complex Networks, especially at their intersection, where I model irregularly structured domains as Graphs and use Deep (Reinforcement) Learning for effective inference.
